# Extra curricular Robotics Workshop
## Raspberry Pi 3

## Course Objectives
The goal for this course was to introduce advanced high school students to core CS concepts like version control and project collaboration using *Git*, the use of Linux and Bash with *Raspbian* and basic programming and object design with *Python*.

## Results
The project consisted of building from scratch a remote controlled car
powered by a Raspberry Pi 3. During the course of 3 months we designed and
built the circuit for the car, and wrote the code for its control via Bluetooth.
