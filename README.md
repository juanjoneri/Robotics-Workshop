# Extra curricular Robotics Workshop

## Course Objectives
The goal for this course was to introduce advanced high school students to core CS concepts like version control and project collaboration using **Git**, the use of Linux and Bash with **Raspbian** and basic programming and object design with **Python**.

## Results
The project consisted of building from scratch a remote controlled car powered by a **Raspberry Pi 3**. During the course of 3 months we designed and built the circuit for the car, and wrote the code for its control via Bluetooth with a Dualshock PS4 controller.
